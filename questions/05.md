# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```rb
class Car

  attr_accessor :name, :owner

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def honk
    "Beep!"
  end

  def take_ownership(owner_name)
    self.owner = owner_name
  end

end

lancelot = Car.new("2003 Mitsubishi Lancer")
```

What will `lancelot.take_ownership("Robert")` return?

## Correct

Robert

> Exactly! It will also set the instance variable `owner` to "Robert".

## Correct
