# OO Concepts

Consider the following code:

```rb
class Car

  attr_accessor :name, :owner

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def honk
    "Beep!"
  end

  def take_ownership(owner_name)
    self.owner = owner_name
  end

  def showing_self
    puts self
  end
end
```

In the `showing_self` method, you can call any instance methods declared in the
class class on `self`.

## Correct

True

> Yes! Any instance methods declared inside a class can be called on `self`.

## Incorrect

False

> Keeping in mind that `self` refers to the specific instance/object of a class,
> which instance methods wouldn't you be able to call on `self`? You might want to
> review the Source/s for this question.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
