# OO Concepts

Consider the following code:

```rb
class Car

  attr_accessor :name, :owner

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def honk
    "Beep!"
  end

  def take_ownership(owner_name)
    self.owner = owner_name
  end

  def showing_self
    puts self
  end
end
```

In the `showing_self` method, if we decided we also want to `puts` "Beep!", what
is the best way to do that?

## Correct

```rb
def showing_self
  puts self
  puts self.honk
```

> Correct! Any instance methods declared inside a class can be invoked from
> inside other methods by calling them on `self`.

## Incorrect

```rb
def showing_self
  puts self
  self.honk
```

> Close! But notice that the `honk` method doesn't invoke `puts`.

## Incorrect

It is not possible to call an instance method from inside another instance
method.

> Incorrect - any instance methods declared inside a class can be invoked from
> inside other methods by calling them on `self`.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
