# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```
class Car

  attr_accessor :name, :owner

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def honk
    "Beep!"
  end

  def get_title(owner_name)
    self.owner = owner_name
  end

end

lancelot = Car.new("2003 Mitsubishi Lancer")
```

What will `lancelot`&nbsp;return?

## Correct

An instance of `Car` with its `@name`&nbsp;defined

> Perfect! `Car.new` was called with the name of the car, which resulted in an
> instance of `Car` being returned and the `@name` instance variable being set.

## Incorrect

`nil`

> When `new` is called on `Car`, it triggers the `initialize` method, which
> expects an argument. What does calling `new` on a class return when the syntax
> is correct?

## Incorrect

```
2003 Mitsubishi Lancer
```

> That is the value stored in the instance variable `@name`. What does calling
> `new` on a class return?

## Incorrect

An instance
of&nbsp;`Car`&nbsp;with&nbsp;`@name`&nbsp;and&nbsp;`@owner`&nbsp;defined

> Take a look at `initialize`. Which properties does it set?

## Incorrect

I don't know.
