# Self

Consider the following code:

```rb
class Dog
  attr_accessor :name

  def good
    self.name + " is a good dog"
  end
end

harpo = Dog.new
harpo.name = "Harpo"
harpo.good
```

In the `good` method, the `self` keyword refers to the:

## Correct

The specific instance, or object, that the method is being called on.

> Awesome! `self` refers to the specific instance which has its own
> characteristics. `self` in an instance method will always refer to the
> instance.

## Incorrect

The `Dog` class.

> If `self` referred to `class Dog` that would mean that `self.name` inside
> `good` would be the same as calling `Dog.name`. Something about that doesn't
> seem right. What has a `name`: a `Dog` class or an instance?

## Incorrect

Every instance, or object, of the `Dog` class.

> Objects are self aware, but they aren't automatically aware of all of the
> other objects instantiated from a class. Does `self` refer to one object or
> many objects?

## Incorrect

I don't know.
