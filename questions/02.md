# Self

Consider the following code:

```
class Dog
  attr_accessor :name
  
  def good
    self.name + " is a good dog"
  end
end

harpo = Dog.new
harpo.name = "Harpo"
harpo.good
```

In the `good`&nbsp;method, the&nbsp;`self`&nbsp;keyword refers to the:

## Correct

specific instance, or object, that the method is being called on

> Awesome! `self` refers to the specific instance which has its own
> characteristics.

## Incorrect

`class Dog`

> If `self` referred to `class Dog` that would mean that `self.name` inside `good`
> would be the same as calling `Dog.name`. Something about that doesn't seem
> right. What has a `name`: a Dog or an instance?

## Incorrect

every instance, or object, of the `Dog` class

> Objects are self aware, but they aren't automatically aware of all of the other
> objects insantiated from a class. Does `self` refer to one object or many
> objects?

## Incorrect

I don't know.
