# OO Syntax

Consider the following code:

```
class Car

  attr_accessor :name, :owner

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def honk
    "Beep!"
  end

  def get_title(owner_name)
    self.owner = owner_name
  end

end

lancelot = Car.new("2003 Mitsubishi Lancer")
```

After `lancelot.get_title("Robert")` is called, what will&nbsp;`lancelot`
return? (Select the **best** answer)

## Correct

An instance of&nbsp;`Car` with `@name` and `@owner`&nbsp;defined

> Correct! `@name` was defined when the instance was created and `@owner` was
> defined when `get_title` was called, and `lancelot` is storing the object
> itself.

## Incorrect

```
Robert
```

> "Robert" is the name of the owner. What is stored in `lancelot`?

## Incorrect

```
2003 Mitsubishi Lancer
```

> This is the value of `@name` and it's a String. What type of data is stored in
> `lancelot`? What properties does it have?

## Incorrect

An instance of&nbsp;`Car`&nbsp;with&nbsp;`@name`&nbsp;defined

> Partly correct. An instance with `@name` defined will be returned, but we must
> remember that `get_title` was also called. What happened when that method was
> called?

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
