Adding methods to Ruby's core classes.

> classes, for example.

> Exactly! We can entirely overwrite an existing method or add to its
> functionality. We don't recommend doing this though - it could cause a lot of
> confusion and bugs.

## Incorrect

Writing Ruby classes from scratch

> This is not a part of monkey patching because we wouldn't be patching
> anything. We'd just be declaring an entirely new class.

## Incorrect

I don't know
